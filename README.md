# 21 Days DSA Challenge ðŸš€

This repository contains my solutions and learnings from the **21-Day Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Challenge**. I am solving 5 problems every day to build a strong foundation in programming and improve my logic-building skills.

## ðŸ“… Day 1 - Arrays Basics

### âœ… Concepts Learned:
- Finding the **largest** element in an array
- Finding the **smallest** element in an array
- Finding the **second largest** element
- **Reversing** an array
- **Sorting** arrays

### ðŸ§  Problems Solved:
| File            | Problem Description                         |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `day1sum1.py`    | Find the **largest** element in an array     |
| `day1sum2.py`    | Find the **smallest** element in an array    |
| `day1sum3.py`    | Find the **second largest** element          |
| `day1sum4.py`    | Reverse an array                             |
| `day1sum5.py`    | Sort an array                                |

## âœ¨ Reflection

Today I learned that **logic building is so important** in problem-solving.  
I'm happy and motivated to be learning thisâ€”it feels good to build these foundations and understand how things work under the hood.  

Every line of code teaches something, and Iâ€™m excited to continue this journey for the next 20 days! ðŸš€

## ðŸ“… Day 2 - Array Problems

### âœ… Concepts Practiced:
- Identifying unique elements
- Finding missing numbers in sequences
- Handling unsorted arrays
- Two-pointer technique for pair sum

### ðŸ§  Problems Solved:
| File            | Problem Description                                      |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `day2sum1.py`   | Print all **unique elements** from an array              |
| `day2sum2.py`   | Find the **missing numbers** in a continuous sequence    |
| `day2sum3.py`   | Find the **missing numbers** in an **unsorted array**    |
| `day2sum4.py`   | Find a **pair of numbers** in an array equal to target   |


## ðŸš€ How to Run

```bash
python Day1/day1sum1.py
