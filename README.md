Today I learned how modulo and integer division can help in counting operations efficiently.
I also practiced the sliding window concept by checking duplicates within a limited distance, which is a useful pattern for future array problems.

I feel more confident in breaking problems into small logical steps and writing clear, structured code. Looking forward to applying these concepts in upcoming challenges! ðŸš€

**âœ¨ Reflection (Day 8)**

Today I explored a variety of **LeetCode Easy Array problems**.  
Each problem gave me a different perspective:
- Two Sum taught me the importance of nested loops and how hashmaps could optimize.  
- Missing Number strengthened my grasp on sorted arrays and edge cases.  
- Contains Duplicate reinforced set/hash-based checking.  
- Stock Profit problem showed me how greedy approaches minimize extra iterations.
