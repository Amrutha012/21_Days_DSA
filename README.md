# 21 Days DSA Challenge ðŸš€

This repository contains my solutions and learnings from the **21-Day Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Challenge**.  
I am solving problems every day to build a strong foundation in programming and improve my logic-building skills.

## ðŸ“… Day 1 - Arrays Basics

### âœ… Concepts Learned:
- Finding the **largest** element in an array
- Finding the **smallest** element in an array
- Finding the **second largest** element
- **Reversing** an array
- **Sorting** arrays

### ðŸ§  Problems Solved:
| File            | Problem Description                         |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `day1sum1.py`   | Find the **largest** element in an array     |
| `day1sum2.py`   | Find the **smallest** element in an array    |
| `day1sum3.py`   | Find the **second largest** element          |
| `day1sum4.py`   | Reverse an array                             |
| `day1sum5.py`   | Sort an array                                |

## âœ¨ Reflection (Day 1)
Today I learned that **logic building is so important** in problem-solving.  
I'm happy and motivated to be learning thisâ€”it feels good to build these foundations and understand how things work under the hood.  

Every line of code teaches something, and Iâ€™m excited to continue this journey for the next 20 days! ðŸš€

## ðŸ“… Day 2 - Array Problems

### âœ… Concepts Practiced:
- Identifying unique elements
- Finding missing numbers in sequences
- Handling unsorted arrays
- Two-pointer technique for pair sum

### ðŸ§  Problems Solved:
| File            | Problem Description                                      |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `day2sum1.py`   | Print all **unique elements** from an array              |
| `day2sum2.py`   | Find the **missing numbers** in a continuous sequence    |
| `day2sum3.py`   | Find the **missing numbers** in an **unsorted array**    |
| `day2sum4.py`   | Find a **pair of numbers** in an array equal to target   |

---
### ðŸ’¡ Reflection (Day 2):
Today I understood how to **analyze arrays deeply** â€” not just looping but also thinking about uniqueness, missing elements, and sums.  
The **two-pointer technique** was a bit tricky at first, but once I figured it out, it made problem-solving feel much more logical.

## ðŸ“… Day 3 - Array Operations

### âœ… Concepts Practiced:
- Intersection of arrays
- Union of arrays
- Combining union and intersection
- Removing common elements from one array

### ðŸ§  Problems Solved:
| File                      | Problem Description                                          |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `intersection.py`         | Find the **intersection** of two arrays                      |
| `union.py`                | Find the **union** of two arrays                             |
| `union_intersection.py`   | Find **both union and intersection** of two arrays           |
| `remove_common.py`        | Remove **common numbers** from the first array               |

---

### ðŸ’¡ Reflection (Day 3):
Day 3 helped me to **think in multiple directions** for one array â€” max/min, order, rotations, and patterns.  
I realized that many problems can be solved with **simple observations** instead of brute force.  
Learning to use Python dictionaries for frequency made my code much cleaner and efficient.

## ðŸ“… Day 4 - Arrays: Alternate Elements

### âœ… Concepts Learned:
- Accessing **alternate elements** of an array  
- Using the **`range()` function with step** to iterate selectively  
- Strengthened understanding of **array indexing** and loops  

### ðŸ§  Problems Solved:
| File            | Problem Description                         |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `day4sum1.py`   | Print **alternate elements** of an array starting from the first element |

---

## âœ¨ Reflection (Day 4)
Today I learned how to **efficiently access alternate elements** using Python loops and the `range()` function.  

Itâ€™s exciting to see how small tweaks in iteration logic can simplify a problem significantly.  
I feel more confident in manipulating arrays and understanding index-based operations.  

This practice also reminds me that **breaking problems into smaller steps** makes coding much easier and less error-prone.  
Iâ€™m motivated to keep building my DSA skills for the upcoming days! ðŸš€
